I built an HTML page with a Guessing Game. The guessing game contains true or false questions relating to my life.

### Reflections and Comments
The ways in which I hope to evaluate and plan my learning:

1. One of the primary ways is to write by hand. I write my by hand, and I later rewrite via my computer. Examples include writing out my notes, journals, quizzes, etc. Not only will revising through this method create better organization and structure, but it is a great way to go over the material again and identify confusing or difficult topics. 

2. Planning to get ahead of the coursework schedule will also contribute to a better learning experience. In the beginning of my undergraduate program at Loyola Marymount University, I procrastinated in doing any work ahead of time. This obviously resulted in poor grades and also depression and self-doubt. By completing some of the course work ahead of time will permit me the opportunity to highlight themes or topics I am having difficulty comprehending. 

3. I also will allot time to evaluate on how I am mentally. I am guilty of sometimes focusing too closely on perfecting coursework that I lose track of my well being. Examples include poor eating and drinking habits and less sleeping. By doing these journals and also keeping a coursework planner will help keep myself in check. Thus, I will not only use these journals to keep track of my learning progress, but also on my mental health (more than 3-4 times a week).
